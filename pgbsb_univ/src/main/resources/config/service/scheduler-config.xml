	====================================================================
	[0 0 * * * *] 			= the top of every hour of every day.
	[*/10 * * * * *] 		= every ten seconds.
	[0 0 8-10 * * *] 		= 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day.
	[0 0/30 8-10 * * *] 	= 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30 and 10 o'clock every day.
	[0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI] 	= on the hour nine-to-five weekdays
	[0 0 0 25 12 ?] 		= every Christmas Day at midnight
	Cron expression is represented by six fields:
	=====================================================================
	second, minute, hour, day of month, month, day(s) of week (*) means match any
	>> */X means "every X"
	
	0			0			0			0			0			0
	second		minute		hours		day			mounth		?
	? ("no specific value") - useful when you need to specify something in one of 
	the two fields in which the character is allowed, but not the other. 
	For example, if I want my trigger to fire on a particular day of the month (say, the 10th),
	but don't care what day of the week that happens to be, I would put "10" in the day-of-month field, 
	and "?" in the day-of-week field.
